# plant-journal

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Features - to be implemented

- 🏗 Advice on how to treat certain plants

- 🏗 Import information for different plants

- 🏗 Create, edit and delete plant entries

- 🏗 Overview of your plants

- 🏗 Reminders when you should look after your plant next based on entered parameters

- 🏗 Dark Mode

- 🏗 and more to come...

🦾 Stay on top of the plant game and lean back since the app reminds you when it's time to pour them again

## Tech Stack (WIP)

- ⚡️ [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/core), [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) - born with fastness

- 🍍 [State Management via Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)

- 🔥 Use the [new `<script setup>` syntax](https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/pull/227)

- 🤙🏻 [Reactivity Transform](https://vuejs.org/guide/extras/reactivity-transform.html) enabled

- 📥 [APIs auto importing](https://github.com/antfu/unplugin-auto-import) - use Composition API and others directly

- ⚙️ Unit Testing with [Vitest](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest), E2E Testing with [Cypress](https://cypress.io/) on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

- 🦾 TypeScript, of course

- ☁️ Deploy on xxx, zero-config

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
